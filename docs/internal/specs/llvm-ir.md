# Spec: LLVM-IR mode

Behavior specification for the `llvm-ir` mode: which subset of LLVM-IR the line-oriented
parser accepts (`src/parser/llvm/`) and how the AST becomes a control-flow graph
(`src/graphBuilder/llvmGraphBuilder.ts`). The design and its rationale live in
`docs/internal/plans/2026-07-llvm-line-oriented-parser.md`; this spec pins the resulting
behavior.

Conventions: every normative statement carries a **Pinned by** reference to the test(s) that
fix the behavior. Statements marked _observed, untested_ describe current behavior with no
covering test.

## 1. Input model

The input is processed line by line, in three layers: physical lines become **logical
lines** (comment stripping, continuation joining, 1-based source line numbers), each logical
line is **classified** by its leading keyword, and classified lines are **assembled** into an
`LLVMModule` by a two-state machine (top level ⇄ in-function). Every line is consumed
exactly once; there is no backtracking. One bad line inside a function degrades to an opaque
instruction instead of failing the whole parse (see §3.4).

`;` comments are stripped anywhere, string-aware: a `;` inside a string literal is data,
not a comment. Blank and comment-only lines produce no logical line.

> Pinned by: `logicalLines.test.ts` ("blank and comment-only lines"),
> `src/parser/__tests__/llvm/errors.test.ts` ("semicolon comments")

`; <label>:N` comments are stripped like any comment, but their `N` is retained as a
block-boundary hint for implicit block numbering (§3.3).

> Pinned by: `logicalLines.test.ts` ("label hints")

**Version coverage:** the parser accepts printer output from LLVM ~2.x through current —
typed pointers and the `unwind` terminator (2.x), `; <label>:N` unnamed blocks and old-style
`load`/`getelementptr` (3.x–6.x), printed numeric labels (7.x–13.x), opaque `ptr`,
`#dbg_*` records and `callbr` (14+). The acceptance evidence is the corpus: 25 `probe-*.ll`
snippets plus 6 `era-*.ll` files, one per era, each with a hand-written CFG projection.

## 2. Accepted top-level entries

A module is a sequence of the following, in any order and any count:

| Entry           | Syntax accepted                                     | Parsed into                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Function        | `define <header> @name(<params>) <attrs> {` … `}`   | `LLVMFunction` (structural — see §3)                  |
| Declaration     | `declare <rest of line>`                            | `LLVMDeclaration` (raw text; `name` is not extracted) |
| Global variable | `@name = <rest of line>`                            | `LLVMGlobalVariable` (name + raw value text)          |
| Attribute group | `attributes #N = <rest of line>` (also `#"string"`) | `LLVMAttributeGroup` (id + raw value text)            |
| Metadata        | `!id = <rest of line>`                              | `LLVMMetadata` (id + raw value text)                  |
| Target          | `target <rest of line>`                             | `LLVMTarget`                                          |
| Source filename | `source_filename = "<string>"`                      | `LLVMSourceFilename`                                  |
| Type alias      | `%name = type <rest of line>`                       | Dropped (classified, not kept in the AST)             |
| Comdat          | `$name = comdat <rest of line>`                     | Dropped, diagnostic-free                              |
| Module asm      | `module asm "<string>"`                             | Dropped, diagnostic-free                              |
| uselistorder    | `uselistorder… <rest of line>`                      | Dropped, diagnostic-free                              |

Entries are classified into dedicated arrays on `LLVMModule`; multiple functions keep their
source order. Any other non-blank top-level line throws (§3.4).

> attribute-group form by `classify.test.ts` (the `attributes #"a b"` table row) and
> `module.test.ts` ("attribute group id is a quoted string")

Note the "rest of line" pattern: most non-function entries are captured **textually**, not
structurally. Their bodies are never re-parsed; node components render `originalText` as-is.

## 3. Functions, blocks, instructions

- A function is `define` + free-text header (return type, cconv, etc., captured as text) +
  `@name` + parameter list + optional attribute text + a braced body. The `{` must sit at
  the end of the define line (§3.4 otherwise). Parameters are split at top-level commas;
  each keeps its raw type text and its `%name` (or `name: null` for unnamed and `...`
  parameters). `LLVMFunction.definition` is the single-spaced define line without the `{`.
  > Pinned by: `module.test.ts` ("define line parsing"),
  > `moduleStructure.test.ts` ("defines parameters")
- The body is one entry block (label optional; id per §3.3) followed by further blocks,
  each started by a label line (`ident:`, `"quoted":`, or numeric `7:`) or — after a
  terminator — implicitly by the next instruction line. Block order is preserved; the entry
  block is also stored as `LLVMFunction.entry`.
  > Pinned by: `moduleStructure.test.ts`, `invariants.test.ts` ("entry block inside parsed
  > blocks"), `classify.test.ts` ("classifyBody labels"), `module.test.ts` ("implicit block
  > numbering (§3.3)")
- Block items are instructions or debug records (`#dbg_*` lines, kept as raw text). Every
  block must end with a terminator (§3.2); a missing one is either a structural error or
  the label-recovery case of §3.4.
  > Pinned by: `src/parser/__tests__/llvm/terminators.test.ts`,
  > `classify.test.ts` ("classifyBody debug records and fallback")
- Non-terminator instructions are parsed into loose categories: `store`/`cmpxchg`/`atomicrmw`
  (operand-scanned, write-target heuristics), calls (`[%dst =] [tail|musttail|notail] call ...`,
  callee = last `@x`/`%x` before the **last** top-level paren group, which also covers the
  2.x fn-pointer-type form), assignments (`%x = <opcode> ...`), and generic instructions.
  All keep `originalText`; operand extraction is heuristic and per-token (globals `@x`,
  locals `%x`, metadata `!x`, everything else is `Other`).

### 3.1 Logical-line joining

Applied only inside a function body, after comment stripping:

1. **Bracket continuation.** A line with an unbalanced `[` (outside strings) absorbs the
   following lines until balanced — this joins the multi-line `switch` case list (LLVM
   prints one case per line) and multi-line `callbr`/`indirectbr` target lists. A `[` still
   open at `}` or EOF is a structural error (§3.4).
   > Pinned by: `logicalLines.test.ts` ("bracket continuation", "unbalanced brackets"),
   > `module.test.ts` ("should escalate the reader diagnostic to a throw")
2. **`to`-continuation.** A line whose successor starts with `to label` or `unwind label`
   absorbs that successor — this joins the modern two-line `invoke` printing.
   > Pinned by: `logicalLines.test.ts` ("to-continuation in a function body")
3. Nothing else joins. In particular, `landingpad` clause lines printed on their own line
   (`cleanup`, `catch …`, `filter …`) do not join; each becomes a separate opaque
   instruction, which is harmless for the CFG (_observed, untested — the corpus landingpads
   are single-line_).

Joined logical lines keep the 1-based line number of their first physical line;
`originalText` keeps every physical line, trimmed and newline-joined.

> `src/parser/llvm/__tests__/instructions.test.ts` ("originalText")

### 3.2 Terminators

Terminator keyword table — the first token of the logical line, or the token after `%x =`
for `invoke`/`callbr` only:

`ret`, `br`, `switch`, `indirectbr`, `invoke`, `callbr`, `resume`, `unreachable`,
`cleanupret`, `catchret`, `catchswitch`, `unwind` (the LLVM ≤ 2.x terminator).

> Pinned by: `classify.test.ts` ("classifyBody terminators" — including the exactly-12 pin
> and the `%x = <non-invoke>` exclusion)

**Uniform successor rule (normative):** the successors of any terminator are the ordered
occurrences of the token pair `label %x` in its logical line; string literals are single
opaque tokens, so `label` text inside them never counts, and `unwind to caller` has no
`label` token and thus no successor.

> Pinned by: `src/parser/llvm/__tests__/terminators.test.ts` ("opaque terminators (uniform
> successor rule)")

Per-opcode structure, on top of that rule:

| Terminator                                                      | Parsed into                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `br label %a`                                                   | `LLVMBrInstruction` with `destination`                                                                                                           |
| `br <ty> <val>, label %a, label %b`                             | `LLVMBrInstruction` with `condition`/`trueTarget`/`falseTarget`; any single type token (old IR used `bool`) and any value token (`%x`, literals) |
| `ret [ <ty...> [<val>] ]`                                       | `LLVMRetInstruction`; the last value-like token is `value`, the tokens before it are the raw `valType`                                           |
| `switch <ty> <val>, label %d [ <cases> ]`                       | `LLVMSwitchInstruction`; each case value is its raw source text only (`-1`, `0x10`, `4294967296` — no type prefix)                               |
| `[%x =] invoke … to label %ok unwind label %err`                | `LLVMInvokeInstruction` with `callee` (same heuristic as calls), `normalTarget`, `unwindTarget`, optional `result`                               |
| `callbr`, `indirectbr`, `cleanupret`, `catchret`, `catchswitch` | `LLVMOpaqueTerminator`: opcode + uniform-rule `successors`                                                                                       |
| `unreachable`, `resume`, `unwind`                               | `LLVMOpaqueTerminator` with `successors: []` — they are not returns and get no exit edge (§4)                                                    |

> `corpus.test.ts` (probe-04/06/13/14/20, era-2x/era-cpp-eh/era-switch-heavy)

**Degradation:** a `br`/`switch`/`invoke` whose expected structure cannot be found (missing
targets, missing case brackets, missing `to label`/`unwind label` clause) degrades to an
`LLVMOpaqueTerminator` that keeps the opcode and the uniform-rule successors — never a throw,
never a structured node with fabricated fields. Consumers must therefore dispatch on field
presence, not opcode (§4).

Trailing `, !dbg !7`-style metadata after the recognized structure is ignored and can never
fail the parse. `parseTerminator` is total: it never throws, on any input.

### 3.3 Implicit block numbering

A block that starts without a label line gets its id from, in priority order:

1. the `N` of an adjacent `; <label>:N` boundary comment (which also resynchronizes the
   counter to N+1);
2. the unnamed-value counter: it starts from the parameter list (each unnamed parameter
   consumes one slot; a parameter printed as `%N` sets the counter to N+1); the unlabeled
   entry block consumes the counter value at function start; thereafter `%N = ...` results
   and printed `N:` labels set the counter to N+1, and each hint-less implicit boundary
   takes the current value. This reproduces LLVM's printer numbering for printer-generated
   input;
3. fallback `implicit_<k>` plus a diagnostic, when the candidate id from 1–2 is already
   taken in the function.

The unlabeled entry block keeps the id `entry` **only when the function body never uses a
numeric label** — a use is a `label %N` token pair, a `; <label>:N` hint, or a phi
incoming-block reference `[ v, %N ]`; numeric instruction results (`%1 = ...`) do **not**
count. Otherwise the entry takes the counter value (e.g. `0`, or `3` after three unnamed
parameters).

Every terminator target that no block id claims produces a diagnostic — never a throw,
never a silent dangling edge.

### 3.4 Error policy

| Input                                                                                                                                         | Behavior                                                                                          |

| Recoverable oddity (implicit-id fallback, dangling terminator target, label after an unterminated block)                                      | Recorded in `LLVMModule.diagnostics` (present only when non-empty), not thrown                    |

**Label-after-unterminated-block recovery:** when a label line arrives while the previous
block has no terminator, the parser does not throw and does not absorb the label. The
previous block is closed with a synthetic empty terminator (`opcode: ""`, no successors —
so it contributes no CFG edge), a diagnostic is recorded, and the label starts its block
normally.

> Pinned by: `module.test.ts` ("label follows an unterminated block"); the no-edge half

`LLVMModule.diagnostics` entries carry a 1-based `line` and a `message`. No UI consumes
them yet (see the plan's follow-ups).

## 4. CFG construction rules

Node kinds produced (see `contracts/graph-data.md` for the `nodeType`↔`astData` mapping):

| `nodeType`                                                                           | One per                    | Notes                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `llvm-functionHeader`                                                                | function                   | Rounded node with the `define ...` line |
| `llvm-basicBlock`                                                                    | basic block                | Header chip shows the block label       |
| `llvm-exit`                                                                          | function **with ≥1 `ret`** | Single shared exit node per function    |
| `llvm-globalVariable` / `llvm-attributeGroup` / `llvm-metadata` / `llvm-declaration` | module entry               | Free-standing nodes, no edges           |

Edge rules:

1. Function header → entry block.
2. `br i1 %c, label %a, label %b` → two edges labeled `true` / `false`.
3. `br label %a` → one unlabeled edge.
4. `ret` → edge to the function's exit node (created on first `ret`).
5. `switch` → one edge labeled `default` plus one edge per case labeled with the case's
   value text.
6. `invoke` → one edge labeled `to` (normal target) and one labeled `unwind` (unwind
   target).
7. Any other terminator carrying `successors` → one unlabeled edge per successor, in order
   (`callbr`, `indirectbr`, `catchret`, `cleanupret`, `catchswitch`, and degraded
   `br`/`switch`/`invoke`).
8. A terminator with empty `successors` (`unreachable`, `resume`, `unwind`) → no edges and
   no exit node.

> Pinned by: `src/graphBuilder/__tests__/llvm/edges.test.ts` (one case per rule),
> `src/graphBuilder/__tests__/llvm/nodes.test.ts`

The dispatch narrows on the **shape** of the terminator (presence of `condition`,
`destination`, `defaultTarget`, `normalTarget`, `successors`), not on its opcode: a degraded
`switch` still has opcode `"switch"` but no `cases` field and must fall through to the
uniform-successor rule instead of crashing.

`parseLLVM(input)` is exactly `convertASTToGraph(parseLLVMToAST(input))`.

ID namespacing: node ids embed the function name (`func_<name>_block_<label>` etc.) so
multiple functions can reuse block labels (`entry`, numeric labels) without collision; ids
are unique across the whole graph.

## 5. Known limitations

- **Duplicate explicit labels are not diagnosed.** Two `a:` labels in one function produce
  two blocks with the same id — and thus colliding graph node ids (_observed, untested_).
  The implicit-numbering collision fallback (§3.3) covers implicit ids only.
- `catchswitch`, `catchret`, `cleanupret`, `callbr`, and `indirectbr` are understood only
  through the uniform successor rule: their edges are unlabeled and carry no per-opcode
  semantics (e.g. a `callbr` fallthrough edge is not distinguished from its indirect
  targets).
  > Pinned by: `terminators.test.ts` ("opaque terminators"), `edges.test.ts` ("successors")
- `landingpad` clause continuation lines (`cleanup` / `catch …` / `filter …` printed on
  their own line) become separate opaque instructions in the block (_observed, untested_);
  single-line landingpads — what the corpus contains — parse as one instruction.
- `phi` instructions do not contribute edges (they are generic instructions textually).
  > Pinned by: `classify.test.ts` ("when a phi uses bracketed block refs, should classify
  > instruction")
- Operand classification is heuristic; it exists for potential future use (e.g. def-use
  highlighting), and only the write-target marking of `store`/`cmpxchg`/`atomicrmw` is
  exercised. The callee-extraction heuristic (§3) is deliberately unchanged from the legacy
  parser.
- Comments (`;`) are stripped and not preserved anywhere (label hints excepted, §1).
- `LLVMModule.diagnostics` is recorded but not surfaced in the UI.
- Extracting declaration names is still not done (`LLVMDeclaration.name` is always the
  literal `"declaration"`).
